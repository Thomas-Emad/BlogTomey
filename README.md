# BlogTomey

### How Are You Guys? ü§î
### Finish BlogTomey as a training.‚ù§
 - The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe website is similar to Blogger, where you can upload Posts and so on.
 - You would like to try the site yourself, but I will tell you the steps as an idea.
 
 #### Permissions
  - Owner = Can Do Every Thing [Change Title Site, Add Types Post, Add Url in Nav, Delete User, Change Permission For User, Add New Post]
  - Admin = Can Do Some Thing [Add New Post, Delete Post, Delete Any Comment].
  - Editor = Can Do Some Thing [Add New Post, Delete His Post].
  - User = Can Do Thing [Login Dashboard, Change His Name And Image Profile].

If you are going to try it yourself: you can try this email or create a new account.
- Email: admin@gmail.com
- Password: 123456
- Your Permissions: Editor.
You can try from [Here](https://thomas-emad.ml/projects/BlogTomey/index.php).

If you will create a new account:-
- You write your data as normal after that.
- You will open your email to activate the account. That's it.
You can Add Post that you can view, you can search in the search box By His Name, and some nice things that you would like to try.

- Well, You Can Change some information changed after creating an account From Dashboard.
- On this page, make a 404 Error.
- Of course, if you delete your account or Post, files such as photos, and so on will be deleted along with it.

#### Which I used:-
1- HTML, CSS, Bootstrap.
2- PHP, MySQL, Phpmyadmin.
3- Dashboard (Soft Ui Dashboard).
4- phpmailer: To confirm the email, and I forgot the password.
